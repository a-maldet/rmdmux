The **rmdmux** package is an **R** package, which extends [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown).
It offers two additional output formats:

- `html_rmdmux_paged`: A beautiful **PDF** report
- `html_rmdmux_plain`: A plain **HTML** file, which fulfills the [WAI requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI)
  and is therefore fully accessible by assistive reading devices like screen readers
  
With **rmdmux** you can create **a single RMD file** (see [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown)) and export it as PDF and
as accessible HTML file.

> Documents should be beautiful and accessible! 

The **rmdmux** package is a minor extension/variation of the wonderful
**[pagedown](https://pagedown.rbind.io/)** package and therefore
uses the **[pagedjs](https://pagedjs.org)** Javascript library in order to
create paginated HTML files.

## Install

Please install the following R packages from **github**:

- [funky](https://github.com/a-maldet/funky)
- [composerr](https://github.com/a-maldet/composerr)
- [styledTables](https://github.com/R-package/styledtable) (v0.2.0 - deprecated, will hopefully be replaced by **styledtable** till May 2023)
- [xlsxcollection](https://github.com/a-maldet/xlsxcollection) (Optional: Used for Excel export)
- [rmdmux](https://github.com/a-maldet/rmdmux)

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
devtools::install_github('a-maldet/funky', build_opts = NULL)
devtools::install_github('a-maldet/composerr', build_opts = NULL)
devtools::install_github('R-package/styledTables', ref = "v0.2.0", build_opts = NULL)
devtools::install_github('a-maldet/rmdmux', build_opts = NULL)

# Optional (needed for Excel export)
devtools::install_github('a-maldet/xlsxcollection', build_opts = NULL)
```

## Getting started

In order to understand the usage of **rmdmux** we recommend you to look at
the build-in example `ex1`.
The following code copies the entire example code into our current working directory

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# copy `ex1/` to current working directory
rmdmux::create_example_1(".")
```

You can now render the report by calling 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
rmdmux::inf_mr("ex1_main.Rmd", output_format = "rmdmux::html_rmdmux_paged")
```

If you open the url `127.0.0.1:4321/ex1_main.html` in **Google Chrome**
you should be able to see the paginated version of the `ex1` report.
There you will find a more detailed manual for **rmdmux**.

### Rendering the report

There are several ways to render the report:

- `rmdmux::print_chrome("ex1_main.Rmd", output_format = "rmdmux::html_rmdmux_paged")`:
  This call prints the paginated report to a PDF file.
- `rmarkdown::render("ex1_main.Rmd", output_format = "rmdmux::html_rmdmux_plain")`: 
  This call renders the report as a plain HTML file which fulfills the
  [WAI requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI) and is accessible by
  screen readers.
- `rmdmux::inf_mr("ex1_main.Rmd", output_format = "rmdmux::html_rmdmux_paged")`:
  This call is very useful, when you are working on report, since it
  will start a local **http** server, serving the rendered document as an
  HTML document. You can look at the report by opening the url 
  `127.0.0.1:4321/ex1_main.html` in **Google Chrome**.
  If you change one of your RMD files the report will automatically be 
  rerendered and you just need to refresh your browser.
  In order to quit the **http** server, just call `rmdmux::daemon_stop()`.
